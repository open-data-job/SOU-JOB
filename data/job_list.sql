INSERT INTO `job_list` VALUES ('0000004159', 'PhD Studentship – Free energy calculations in drug discovery', '\n            <p>Supervisors : Prof J Essex and Prof J Frey</p><h2>Project Description</h2><div itemprop=\"mainContentOfPage\">Protein-ligand binding free energy is a crucial property used in the discovery and optimisation of novel drugs. In the context of computer-aided drug design, being able to calculate accurate, precise and reproducible binding free energies in silico is essential in terms of reducing the amount of trial-and-error synthetic effort required to develop a candidate drug. More potent and selective compounds will bind strongly to the desired target, and show weak binding to related proteins. Recent commercial software products have pushed the use of binding free energy calculations into mainstream development pipelines within the pharmaceutical industry. Even with pre-screening of suitable target systems, however, the required predictive accuracy of 1 kcal mol-1 is only attained in around half of cases. Determining whether sufficient accuracy has been achieved for a particular system is currently not possible a priori and requires expensive and time-consuming experimental validation. &nbsp;<br><br>In this project the accuracy of these free energy calculations in the context of the pharmaceutical industry will be explored. We will develop a large dataset of test systems based on published data and determine the sensitivity of the calculated free energies to the choice of simulation software, parameters, free energy calculation method and system setup. Based on this sensitivity analysis, the project objectives are twofold:<br>1. To identify the primary causes of inaccuracy in protein-ligand binding free energy calculations. Through this we will be able to identify a priori on which systems these approaches will be successful. This information will be extremely valuable, allowing those cases where the methods will be useful to be identified without requiring extensive and expensive experimental validation.<br>2. To improve free energy calculation methodology to address these sensitivities. We have considerable experience of optimising free energy methodology, including in recent years the use of advanced force fields and enhanced sampling methods.</div><h2>Funding Notes</h2><p>The project is funded for 3 &frac12; years and welcomes applicants from the UK and EU who have or expect to obtain at least an upper second class degree in Chemistry, Physics, Biochemistry or allied subjects/relevant disciplines.

Such advanced spectroscopy and novel imaging methods are able to extract the chemical composition of biological systems, including living cells, to an unprecedented level of detail, and thus can be used for accurate medical diagnosis and early detection of diseases. The imaging techniques give multicomponent spectral information bearing chemical and structural information that can be complex to disentangle in a robust non-subjective manner.

From social, engineering, biological or communication networks, this approach has improved the understanding of structural and functional properties of such systems. Networks can also be used to describe dynamical systems, that is, systems that change with time. For such systems, a fundamental question is how to guide the system towards desirable states in an optimal way. Examples include the control of oscillations in the brain to mitigate the effects of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, applications in marketing aiming to influence people who exchange opinions on social networks, or even the design of optimal developing strategies for economic activities. This research area, optimal control of networks, has recently received much attention, and novel approaches have the potential of a large impact beyond disciplinary boundaries.</p><p><br></p><p>Solutions to problems of network control usually involve the identification of an optimal set of driver nodes, such that the given system can be steered in a desired direction. Identifying such nodes, in often extremely high-dimensional search spaces, poses an extremely difficult optimization problem in most practical applications. On the other hand, most real-world networks possess structural redundancies (symmetries) which can be exploited in virtually any network analysis, leading to outstanding computational reductions in typical calculations. However, network symmetries have not yet been exploited in network control problems.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In this PhD project, the candidate will develop new algorithms and numerical techniques to solve or approximate network control problems exploiting recent results on network symmetries, which allow the identification of structurally equivalent nodes. Identifying such nodes allows successive reductions of the system complexity, substantially reducing the number of degrees of freedom of any network optimization problem.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The proposed PhD project is interdisciplinary in nature and will bring together recent state-of-the-art insights in the mathematical study of networks by Dr Sanchez-Garcia with recent work in computer science on network control in influence maximization by Dr Brede.

This can be achieved by quantum mechanical calculations from first principles, with Density Functional Theory (DFT). DFT calculations have typically been limited to tens of atoms due to the high computational effort. Recent developments of &ldquo;linear-scaling&rdquo; reformulations of DFT, allow calculations with thousands of atoms. However, DFT is no longer chemically accurate when applied to materials containing heavy f-block elements such as actinides. The reason for this failure is that relativistic corrections are needed to provide an accurate description of the electronic structure as relativistic effects influence the geometries and chemistry of these compounds. Various levels of such relativistic corrections have been implemented in conventional DFT programs but much less is available within linear-scaling DFT formulations which limits their applicability for complex actinide-containing materials.</p><p>The goal of this PhD project is to address this challenge by developing and validating within the ONETEP linear-scaling DFT program (www.onetep.org) the capabilities that are required for accurate large-scale DFT calculations on actinide compounds. This will involve the implementation of a hierarchy of relativistic methods of increasing sophistication, which will need to be reformulated and expressed within the localised non-orthogonal orbital framework on which the ONETEP method is based. The developed methodologies will be validated against experimental and computational data &ndash; provided by the industry partners. Many of these developments will be novel in the area of DFT codes for large-scale calculations and therefore this project represents a great opportunity to make an impact in the field of electronic structure theory method development.</p><p>This project will be carried out in the group of Professor Chris-Kriton Skylaris at the University of Southampton and will include placements and cos-supervision by the industrial partner.

Galling is defined as a form of surface damage arising between sliding surfaces, distinguished by macroscopic roughening which is usually localized, and the creation of protrusions above the original surface; it often includes plastic flow or material transfer, or both, and in the most severe cases may results in parts becoming seized together.<br><br>An issue with the use of the cobalt-based alloys however, is the activation of cobalt by a neutron flux to form the cobalt-60 radionuclide; this isotope is a significant contributor to plant worker dose and the cobalt-based alloys used typically have cobalt compositions in excess of 50%. Whilst significant work is on-going in developing cobalt-free, galling resistant alloys, the use of surface coatings to encapsulate the cobalt-based alloys represents an attractive means of minimizing plant material changes whilst still delivering an effective engineering solution against wear and radiation dose.<br><br>This project will build upon work already started at the university in the modeling of vacuum thin film coatings, specifically the use of diamond-like-carbon coatings, in sliding wear in a simple water environment. This project will focus on simplistic sample geometries and will establish the modeling of the baseline cobalt-base alloy system behaviour, before investigating the coating palliative.

Originally proposed by Turing in 1950, the genetic algorithm was first used by Holland in the 1960&rsquo;s to investigate evolution but has since been successfully adapted to solve optimisation problems. There is a vibrant community of researcher and industrialists developing novel methods to improve the performance of these algorithms allowing more complex problems to solve and allowing their use in new applications.</p><p>Once such method was developed at the University of Southampton (10.1088/1748-3190/aad2e8 and <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.swevo.2018.09.005\">10.1016/j.swevo.2018.09.005</a>) which shows leading performance as a general solver, meaning it performs well across a wide range of problems, and shows particularly good preservation of the diversity of the population. It implements the Multi-Level Selection Theory and co-evolutionary approaches to improve the performance of the algorithm and already shows leading performance on a number of benchmarking problems and real world applications. However, the method is still new and there are a number of improvements that can be made and so this project will focus on its continued development. &nbsp;</p><p>The inspiration for this algorithm is already heavily based in evolutionary theory based on the idea that mechanisms that accelerate the rate of evolution in the natural world, will similarly accelerate the speed of the genetic algorithm. In this project we will take inspiration from epigenetics, transgenerational plasticity, social evolution and multi-level selection theory to test if the performance of the genetic algorithm can be similarly enhanced. Fusing contemporary evolutionary theory with an already highly efficient genetic algorithm has the potential to revolutionise evolutionary computation.</p><p>Candidates must possess at least a 2:1 degree level (or equivalent) qualification and be willing to engage in cross-disciplinary research.

Shipping contributes substantial emissions of toxic or harmful exhaust gas containing compounds, such as CO2, NOx, SOx, particulates, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon residues from diesel engines. Whilst emissions from road traffic and other land-based sources has been either decreasing or holding steady, emissions from shipping have been increasing steadily for decades. A recent Greenhouse Gas Strategy report by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) set an ambitious target of reducing 50% reduction of the current CO2 by 2050. This means we are entering a crucial transition whereby alternative fuels will play a more prominent role.

This project will involve a combination of experimental chemical investigations as well as the development of a catalytic modelling approaches which can capture the CO2 conversion process for a range of operating conditions, typical to the marine emission concentrations, to yield high-value synthetic fuels.

Quantum cryptography, for instance, exploits the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to provide unconditional security for communication. An essential element of secure key distribution in quantum cryptography is an optical source emitting pulses containing one and only one photon, a so-called triggered single-photon source. Since measurements unavoidably modify the state of a single quantum system, an eavesdropper cannot gather information about the secret key without being discovered, if the pulses used in transmission contain only one photon. The field of quantum photonics has seen a tremendous development in recent years, leading to major advances in the understanding and control of solid-state systems at the quantum level. Current technology allows the realization of nanophotonic structures containing quantum emitters that enable single photons to be emitted on demand. These are the building blocks of many quantum information protocols and very exciting prospects seem within reach.

However, very accurate fabrication techniques limit the scalability and wide application of such devices. We have recently demonstrated that imperfections, introduced in the device fabrication, can be used to add functionalities and control the light-matter interaction.</p><p>One of the major advantages in using &ldquo;disordered&rdquo; photonic crystal waveguides to confine light derives from the fact that, in a single waveguide, several cavity modes can co-exist (see image), without the need of fabricating a series of highly engineered photonic crystal cavities. Furthermore, their spatial extension can reach the micron size and, therefore, they show great potential for realizing photonic networks, as spatially extended coupled cavities, so-called necklace states, can spontaneously form.&nbsp;</p><p>The student will fabricate disordered photonic crystal waveguides whose properties are tailored to a specific emitter, thanks to the positioning technique that we have developed. She/he will then characterize the Anderson-localized cavity modes by measuring wavelength, quality factors and spatial extension of the optical modes.<br>&nbsp;The ultimate goal will be the creation of a photonic architecture where the emission from a single emitter is boosted by the coupling to an Anderson-localized cavity. The quantum light will propagate thanks to the hopping from cavity to cavity via coupled necklace states and will be used in quantum information protocols, based, for instance, on interference of single photons.&nbsp;Fabricating photonic crystal waveguides without the stringent requirement of nanometre scale precision in the position, shape and size of the air holes will make the process inherently cheaper and more scalable, since lower resolution tool and faster processes, with no iterations, can be utilised.</p><p>Please note that the position is open for UK or European citizens only.</p><p>For more information, please visit our group website at <a href=\"http://www.quantum.soton.ac.uk/\">http://www.quantum.soton.ac.uk</a><u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</u>contact Dr Luca Sapienza (l.sapienza@soton.ac.uk).</p><p><strong><u>Key facts</u></strong></p><p>Entry requirements: first or upper second-class 4-year degree or Master degree in Physics, chemistry, materials or biology.</p><p><u>Closing date</u>:&nbsp;applications should be received no later than 31 August 2019 for standard admissions, but later applications may be considered depending on the funds remaining in place.</p><p>Duration: four years (full-time)</p><p>Funding: full tuition fees, for UK/EU students, and a tax-free stipend of &pound;14,777 per year</p><p>Assessment: Nine month and 18 month reports, viva voce and thesis examination</p><p>Start date: typically September</p><p>Applying: <a href=\"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/postgraduate/pgstudy/howdoiapplypg.html\">www.southampton.ac.uk/postgraduate/pgstudy/howdoiapplypg.html</a>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>\n            <p>\n              Closing Date: 31 Aug 2019<br />\n              Post Type: PhD Studentship (Funded)\n            </p>\n          ', '10000000', '0', '', '', '1552912910', 'SO16 7PP', '2147483647');

The project will be co-supervised by Professor Chris-Kriton Skylaris and Dr Denis Kramer (Southampton) and Dr Felix Hanke (Dassault Syst&egrave;mes, Cambridge) and will be based in Southampton with substantial placements at the industrial partner in Cambridge.</p><p>A revolution is currently taking place in transport with the rapid growth of clean vehicle technologies. Much of this effort is directed towards electric vehicles which have benefitted from the availability of Li ion batteries which offer a power to weight ratio useful for many applications. However, there are still substantial challenges in terms of battery performance during realistic operating conditions, such as safety, degradation and capacity fade. The key to the solution of many of these issues lies in the materials and the processes they perform within a battery.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This PhD project</strong> will apply highly accurate atomistic simulations on materials and interfaces involved in state-of-the-art battery technologies, to understand how the properties of these complex materials can be tailored to improve battery performance. Specifically, the ion transport properties and the link between material chemistry and battery performance will be explored in detail. &nbsp;</p><p>An essential tool for this task are quantum mechanical calculations from first principles which provide a very accurate description of materials. Conventionally such calculations have been limited to a few hundred atoms at most because the computational effort associated with first principles quantum methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) scales as the third power of the number of atoms and is computationally prohibitive. Recently this situation has started to change due to the ever-increasing power of supercomputers and new developments in theory such as linear-scaling DFT and in particular the ONETEP program for linear-scaling DFT which will be used for this project as it is capable of calculations with thousands of atoms and retains the near-complete basis set accuracy of conventional DFT.&nbsp;</p><p>A prominent role in this work will be played by recent and ongoing developments in ONETEP with novel highly accurate exchange correlation methods, advanced solvent models, and fast configuration sampling techniques. These quantum methods will be further developed and validated in test cases involving battery materials. Examples of areas critical for the understanding of battery functions where these methods can be used include the ion transport in the electrodes and the construction of models of the very complex Solid-Electrolyte Inter-phase (SEI) which is critical for the function of Li-ion batteries. As these are inherently multiscale problems the outputs from these simulations will be used to inform larger-scale models based on classical atomistic and continuum descriptions of materials. The pioneering applications of quantum methods during this PhD will be formulated into workflows that will provide robust generally applicable frameworks suitable for future simulations of batteries.</p><p>Dassault Syst&egrave;mes will provide periods of placement in their research group in Cambridge where the PhD student will be able to get first-hand experience in industry standard multiscale simulation techniques applied to battery materials and in case studies from industry.<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;The project will also involve close interaction with the Multiscale Modelling of Batteries consortium of the Faraday Institution, of which Southampton University is a founding partner.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is a fully funded PhD studentship.

The offer can be for either a PhD (+3) or MSc + PhD (1+3) position.</p><p>One of the key issues in risk management for micro, small and medium businesses (mSME) is the scarcity of reliable data for credit risk evaluations. The current evaluation processes are cumbersome, inefficient, and bias-prone, resulting in widespread underfunding for small businesses, and subsequent reduced productivity. Following the strategic research priority of the ESRC to improve productivity, this project is focused on creating a fair, efficient, and transparent methodology to improve lending to SME standards by increasing available information for evaluations. One of our industry partners has made available to us images of the places of work of a large number of mSME, along with commonly-used structured information on the businesses, and repayment information covering several years of lending practice. This unique dataset is currently being used by human specialists to override automatic decisions, which hints at a great potential to improve the decision-making using the latest image-processing developments in AI.</p><p>The general aim of the PhD project is to create novel AI methodologies to generate image-enriched credit scores modelling the probability of default for micro and small companies, using a mixture of images and structured data. These models should satisfy the legal requirements of banking regulators, in particular those regarding the unfair discrimination regulations, and those regarding explainability of the models.</p><p>While this PhD project is an exciting opportunity to research complex models in credit risk, extreme care must be taken to not include any information that would unfairly discriminate against some sectors of the population, by including e.g. gender or race information. Transparency standards in the lending industry require clear explanations of the reasons why an application is rejected, resulting thus far in the use of simpler models.

To provide analyses in minimal time, empirical approaches, like Gaussian puff methods and single or multizone models, are presently used. Puff methods assume an idealised outdoor emission plume and neglect interaction with complex topologies. Zone models can provide reasonable predictions of dispersion through buildings, but their applicability is questionable for large spaces, where their homogeneous mixing assumption is invalid.<br><br>Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations can overcome the limitations of empirical dispersion models, however the turn-around times for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on complex meshes are enormous. As an alternative, a novel parallel adaptive lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for large eddy simulation (LES) of atmospheric flows is currently under development within our AMROC software framework. In this approach, geometries are represented with automatically generated Cartesian meshes that are non-uniformly refined and de-refined at run time.<br><br>In this PhD project, you will work on fine-tuning the LBM-LES approach for atmospheric dispersion prediction and supplement the method with the following features: realistic inflow conditions to model the atmospheric boundary layer, representation of complex release sources, efficient import of complex geometries. In addition, you will develop a version of the parallel LBM-LES code (written in C++) that is tailored especially for execution on sets of graphical processing units (GPUs) using CUDA or OpenACC. Together, these developments will lead to a step-change in atmospheric flow prediction.

While the impact of uncertainties in the structural parameters are well studied, little has been done on assessing the influence of aerodynamic uncertainties on the system aeroelastic behaviour. In a computational setting, turbulence models based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations remain the workhorse in the computation of high Reynolds-number wall-bounded flows. While these methods have proved their utility in an industrial setting, their deficiencies in modelling complex flows are well-documented. Even the most sophisticated turbulence models invoke radically simplifying assumptions about the structure of the underlying turbulence. Although a model is based on physically and mathematically sound ideas, the model formulation typically devolves into the calibration of many free parameters, called closure coefficients, which balance the turbulence equations. The numerical values of the closure coefficients in current turbulence models are chosen by using a combination of heuristic and empirical decision making using a small set of canonical problems. Therefore, the central question posed in this research project is: Can we quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity of commonly-used RANS models on the system aeroelastic behaviour?<br><br>The aim is to explore novel computational strategies to perform uncertainty quantification of large-scale aeroelastic problems with large numbers of uncertain variables with minimal computing costs. However, propagation of the uncertainties is generally computational intractable due to the expensive fluid component, whereas the structural part is generally cheap. In this research project, we will alleviate this problem through the use of: 1) a machine learning approach which drives an adaptive design of experiments algorithm1 to investigate the propagation of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties to aerodynamics output quantities of interest; and 2) a reduced-order model that propagates efficiently the above-mentioned uncertainties. Armed with this reduced-order model, we will perform uncertainty quantification to estimate the system aeroelastic behaviour.<br><br>The successful applicant will have a background in physics, engineering or applied mathematics.

This is especially true for wind turbines, propellers and other rotating machinery. In these situations, the flow mechanisms and the noise generating features are substantially different compared to lower angles of attack. Our knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms as well as our ability to predict these aerodynamic phenomena and noise sources is limited. In this project, the goal is to carry out detailed near-field flow experiments as well as far-field noise measurements to develop new understanding of the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics in the presence of separation and stall. Three-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry will be performed over a foil in a water channel to elucidate the aerodynamic mechanisms. The 3D data will be combined with new data assimilation strategies to determine the full-field pressure. This pressure field will be used to determine relationship between velocity and pressure across the flow and also used to predict the far-field noise generated by the foil. This prediction can be compared against experiments carried out in an anechoic wind tunnel where far-field noise can be measured directly. Ultimately, the high-fidelity data generated in this project will then be used to identify flow mechanisms that contribute to the different aerodynamic force and noise sources at high angles of attack.</p><p>If you wish to discuss any details of the project informally, please contact Dr Ganapathisubramani, Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics Research Group, Email: <a href=\"mailto:g.bharath@soton.ac.uk\">g.bharath@soton.ac.uk</a> Tel: + 0044 (023) 8059 2305.</p><p><strong>Funding and Eligibility</strong></p><p>This 3 year studentship covers UK/EU level tuition fees and provides an annual tax-free stipend at the standard EPSRC rate, which is &pound;14,777 for 2018/19.</p><p>The funding available is competitive and will only be awarded to an outstanding applicant.

This has open up a new age for the testing of materials where old nominally-uniform or simple stress field configurations can be replaced by more complex ones leading to heterogeneous states of stress and strain. In this case however, the problem is not statically determinate anymore and inverse identification needs to be employed to extract the parameters from the strain maps. Within the last 10 years, the Virtual Fields Method (VFM) has emerged to become the most promising tool for material identification thanks to its spectacular computational efficiency compared to traditional finite element model updating (FEMU). A recent independent study has quoted that the VFM was 125 time faster than FEMU for a hyperelastic model.</p><p>This project is part of a strategic partnership between the University of Southampton and MatchID NV. The Virtual Fields Method championed by Prof. Pierron over the last 20 years is now implemented in MatchID and the integrated DIC/VFM tool is now ready for industrial transfer. However, there is a need for the design of novel test configurations that will strongly benefit from the new paradigm as current tests are generally adapted from existing configurations and not optimal. Recently, Prof. Pierron&rsquo;s research group has set up a procedure based on synthetic image deformation to simulate the complete identification chain from imaging to VFM, so that uncertainties can be propagated through the complex chain and realistic error bounds produced.</p><p>This PhD will take this one step further and look at two problems of material identification: anisotropic elasticity (composites) and either anisotropic plasticity (sheet metal forming) or hyperelasticity (rubber sheets). The design space will be explored using finite element simulations coupled to the identification simulator and promising configurations will be tested extensively to produce robust error bounds. This is an essential step before running inter-laboratory round-robin tests to prove the robustness of the new paradigm and convince industry to take on these new tests. The PhD project is therefore both numerical and experimental.</p><p>The ideal candidate for this project will have a bachelor or master degree in mechanical, materials or civil engineering and have studied fracture mechanics at undergraduate level.

Southampton is leading the UK in cancer immunology research based in the our newly built &pound;25M Centre for Cancer Immunology. Current immune checkpoint inhibitors licenced for clinical use fail many patients with only 10-60% of treated patients reaching objective response rates and this is accompanied by high cost and serious side effects in some patients. It is thought that immunotherapy is not effective in all patients because certain cancer cells can hide or produce signals that stop the immune system from attacking the tumour. The same mechanisms are thought to mitigate against the success of anticancer vaccines. Current research to address the reasons for inter-patient variability in response to immunotherapy has focused on tumour immune phenotypes, somatic mutation, the gut microbiome or host genetics. There is new evidence to suggest that the tumour microenvironment (TME) maybe a determinant of antigen presentation and therefore play an important role in the development of anti-tumour immune responses in cancer. We need innovative research to understand more about the role of the TME in tumour antigen presentation and cancer immunosurveillance.</p><p>This PhD will focus on oesophageal cancer as this disease type has high levels neoantigen presentation and we have world-leading expertise in this field (whole genome sequencing, single-cell sequencing, organoid modelling and immunopeptidomics). &nbsp;As yet these data have not been integrated in a coherent manner to answer important clinical questions. &nbsp;Specifically, this PhD will address the hypothesis that, &lsquo;The tumour microenvironment is a determinant of antigen presentation and immune response in oesophageal cancer&rsquo;. The main aims of this PhD are to: <strong>(1)&nbsp;</strong>Link the tumour transcriptome to the immunopeptidome by mathematical modelling of neo-antigen peptide loading to MHC-I molecules. <strong>(2)&nbsp;</strong>Place antigen presentation into the context of tumour (immune) microenvironment.</p><p>The PhD student will acquire data analytic skills, where they will use predictive mathematical modelling to determine the likelihood of selection, and expression level of tumour neoepitopes and components of the antigen processing and presentation pathway, using immunopeptidomic and transcriptomic data from primary human tumour samples. The student will then extend these analyses via further bioinformatical approaches (WGNCA, CIBERSORT &amp; topological data analysis;); focussing on cytokine gene expression signatures, leukocyte infiltration and cancer-associated fibroblasts. These are all factors that determine immunological control of cancer. The student will then investigate the impact of TME/ tumour immunophenotype on the diversity of immunopeptidome presentation by using our novel antigen presentation reporter systems in organoid models. This work will validate the mathematical models developed to predict the level and diversity of peptide presentation.</p><p>The student will work in the University priority area of Cancer Immunology at the nexus of three Faculty strategic priorities: cross-Faculty multidisciplinary research, patient proximal research with clear translational potential.</p><p><strong>Please contact: Dr Matthew Rose-Zerilli; <a href=\"mailto:mjrz@soton.ac.uk\">mjrz@soton.ac.uk</a>;&nbsp;</strong>Tel: +44(0)23 81205163</p><p><strong>Person Specification:&nbsp;</strong>See below</p><p>The successful candidate is likely to have the following qualifications:</p><ul type=\"disc\"><li>A 1<sup>st</sup>or 2:1 degree in a relevant discipline and/or second degree with a related Masters</li></ul><p><strong>Funding information:&nbsp;</strong>The project is funded for 4 years and welcomes applicants from the UK and EU who have or expect to obtain at least a first class or upper-second degree in Biological Sciences or allied subjects.

As PD progresses, these clumps of aSN spread through the brain from neuron to neuron, causing damage to neurons, and eventually clinical symptoms. The underlying mechanism by which neurons take up misfolded aSN is not fully understood and may require specific receptors. One of these receptors is believed to be the inhibitory FcgRIIb. In this project, we will use a range of biochemical and biophysical approaches to study the interaction between aSN and FcgRIIb, including Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The results will be compared to other misfolded proteins, which are generated in house. The student will then use neuronal cultures to study the underlying mechanism by which aSN spreads from neuron to neuron, using cells derived from wild type mice or mice lacking FcgRIIb. Finally, an experimental mouse model of PD will be used to study the role of FcRIIb in the spread of aSN in vivo. The results of this PhD project can lead to further understanding of the biological pathways that cause neuronal damage in PD and pave the way to a novel type of treatment that prevents or halts this devastating disease.</p><p>This PhD studentship is a collaborative project at the University of Southampton, combining immunology, antibody biology, biochemistry, structural biology and neuroscience.
